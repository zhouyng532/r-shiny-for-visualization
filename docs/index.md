# Welcom to R Shiny for Visualization

This repository is for the "R Shiny for Visualization" course hosted in Expedia Group Code Academy. It is intended for people who have basic knowledge of programming in R, and trying to present analyses / build dashboards on top of it with the help of [shiny package](https://shiny.rstudio.com). It covers the development of the simplest Shiny App to more advanced ones. Most importantly, it guides you on how to apply your creativities on visualization.

## Why use R for visualization?

There are many tools specialized in visualization, why use a statistical tool to visualize? Many analyses require advanced data manipulation, calculation, modelling and prediction that are more natural in a statistical tool like R. When it comes to report your analysis results, building visualization within the same tool can have following advantages:

* You do not need to transfer your data from R to other visualization platform (it can be a pain sometimes!)
* Easy modification and duplications of codes when designing graphs
* Shiny allows high level of flexibility on your app design and you don't need to fit in the framework of general visualization platform
* By having the computational power backing up your visualization, you can easily performe the "what if" analysis during your presentation

the ability to build up an interactive web application makes shiny a good communication tool between technical/statistical world and the strategic/business world.

## What R Shiny can be used for?

* Self-served Reporting Tool: if you are tired for answering the same questions from stakeholders from time to time, build a shiny app for them to find their own answers!
* Normative Advanced Analysis: if you try to make sure that everyone within the company is doing advanced analysis (eg. campaign analysis, forecasting) in a normative and comparable way (eg. using certain parameters), wrap it in a shiny app!
* Algorithm Development: Not sure what algos/parameters to use for your model? Test different ones in a visual way using shiny app!
* Collect User Information: Shiny can not only be a data output but also a data input. Build a nice interface using shiny app to collect your user information for analyses!
